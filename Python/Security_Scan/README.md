# Python Project
- An non-invasive reconnaissance diagnosis for IP camera


## This diagnosis of Non-invasive aims to reconnaissance the IOT devices of some basic information.

## Purpose

- The Non-invasive action would not affact the performance of the devices (in general aspect of attack).
- The diagnosis would tell some basic information that about the IOT device (listed below).
- The diagnosis would use the following resources.

## How
- The diagnosis is using the tool of Scapy.
- The basic environment is Python.
- The target of the diagnosis is a set of Sony IP Cameras (provided by the professor).
- The outcomes would consist of following information:
  ##### Name of IOT device
  ##### The percentage of response devices
  ##### IP(Internet Protocol)-ID(fragment counter) deployed method(include incremental, zero, random) for ICMP protocol
  ##### The percentage of using or port 80
  ##### IP-ID deployed method for TCP protocol
  ##### The percentage of SYN (one-time synchronization) method deployed   
  ##### The probably OS deployed on remote devices
