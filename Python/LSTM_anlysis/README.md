# LSTM project


- Using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) modelling to predict and classification the further trend of network traffic. 
- Research finds the feasibility of detecting further threats using existing data and prediction modelling. 
- Collecting data from real-life (https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/computer-networktraffic). 
- Preprocess the raw data by recalculating the connection times and dealing with the imbalanced data. 
- Training model with LSTM model. This project, based on python, by using the TensorFlow framework, manipulate the LSTM model to train and predict possible outcomes. 
- The data metrics would conduct the result; the prediction accuracy would finally achieve 96%.
